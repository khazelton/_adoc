Good morning!

@Grady Bailey
Happy First-day Grady (probably won't see this until TSG Onboarding is complete - but welcome anyway!)

@here is today's Components agenda draft:

Once you have all had your "editing rights" applied - I'll distribute:

Introduction/Administrative Items (Steve)

Preserving valuable artifacts from T&I Community in a well-known, searchable location; Illustrated with an example: Summary of background (Keith/Rebekah)

Introduction of “Sketcher”

Wireframes concept feedback

Catalyst Updates - Just as we do with the community development projects, each catalyst will be on-deck to help others understand:

What are you working on in support of the community (and of which the Meeting can be aware)?
Are there specific projects which we should know about (and of which we all can be supportive and help promote)?

SAML Metadata Configuration Manager. (Steve)
we've had a hanging-chad with Margaret regarding leading the CACTI topic (from either the last meeting or the one previous - I have to go look it up) in which her epiphany led her to believe that there was discussion she would like to bring to the Components group.  Was that context/content ever hashed-out?

Nicole Roy
No, it was not. I believe there is further discussion to be had with CACTI on the September call.

Steve Zoppi
I added this item to the "wireframes" discussion:
Volunteers for progress checkpoint feedback (Arlen?, Others?...)

BennO offered that he would talk with Arlen about helping with the "between checkpoint" interaction.

https://refeds.org/meetings/48th[] <- Albert reported
https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html[] <- OpenID Federation 1.0 - draft 36.pdf

w3c/openId spec is the focus of Refeds Verifiable Credential

Margaret Cullen: I was surprised by two things from TNC:  
(1) the widespread notion that the eduGain Federation seems to be evolving toward OIDC (although not away from SAML in the short term), and 
(2) how prevalent it is for NRENS (other than the US) to use RADSec for upstream communication with GEANT.

BennO: open source schemes: looking for principles for open source in NRENs; Niels & Dedra both on board of SimpleSAMLphp; starting a funding model; chat w PeterG; FOSSE, Apereo in 2 weeks in Portland; Should we align around organizational/social aspects

NicoleGuido: Open source themes: Allowing too much pushback from vendors; Sustainability across projects; Ensure communities are paying attention to socio as well as technical aspects/issues; Let's reuse wheels rather than each creating our own

DedraCh: I think its critical for the community to acknowledge and welcome vendors who are working to provide solutions essential to the community AND working to support open source solutions
I tried to add that to the mix at the session, but time ran out

https://indico.geant.org/event/4/contributions/266/attachments/239/484/20240611-OSSprinciples.pptx

ScottC: Platforms have diverged so extremely that there are too many app platforms; Java split w Python, wplits with .Net....Cloud is the natural consequence of too much disjoint sets of dev platforms;

SZ: tension btween: we write, ergo we trust. Benefit comes from openness to community input rather than the Torvald model

Dedra Chamberlin to Everyone (Jul 15, 2024, 12:30)
!! There are so many executives that are simply not willing to purchase “open source” solutions

BaseCAMP: A strong sentiment in favor of more demos, integration of TAP w commercial products

SZ: what are the advanced topics BaseCAMP attendees are asking for that would meet highest demand/need?  Catalysts should have some answers based on their experience with customer engagements

    Today 
      - we will focus on some discussions with Boyd Wilson of Omnibond.
        Introduce Omnibond and their products that need or will need federated access.
        Since the InCommon Futures2 document came out 
        Omnibond has been thinking about how the next generation of federation might work.  
        .
      - Specifically: 
            - How to leverage new W3C standards such as 
            Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and 
            Verifiable Credentials (VCs) 
            while still providing an easy upgrade path 
            from the current federated authentication infrastructure.
            - How to grow the utility and usability of federations.

I think InCommon can coordinate these responses, so I do think there is a role to play - It might be helpful to think about the approach that FIM4R took. A large number of representatives gathered to create a combined statement of what is needed. This statement 1) brought clarity to what was needed, and 2) provided insight of who exactly these needs are important to.

Slavek Licehammer: Hi all. Unfortunately, I won't be able to join the meeting today. But I have two ideas for discussion topics for the future meetings

- First one is documentation focused on use-cases. Currently most of TAP documentation is focused of documenting features. In my opinions people would also appreciate documentation for concrete use-cases; basically combining several features together.

- The second topic is an academic profile for midPoint (or even for whole TAP). Meaning having shared configuration profile, with typical settings that the whole community can share (e.g. schema, basic dashboards, notifications, roles, archetypes and so on).

- use cases
- erp/grpr
- standardized grpr/mp perf analysis (based on WBench)

Draft agenda for components for March 11th:
Welcome James Cramton, InCommon Industry Program Manager
Quarterly updates from the components

Draft email to component architects (targeted to Laura/BennO, Hyzer, Scott, Slavek:

Dear Component Architects,

I’ll be running the March 11th call, and we’d like to do a round-up of quarterly updates of initiatives and talking points for each of the components (COmanage, midPoint, Shibboleth, Grouper) with a focus on planning and coordination for shared initiatives such as the nascent telemetry requirements and interconnectivity/coherence between components as well as packaging. Other items of interest include initiatives that you want to undertake in Q2 and beyond, which require funding from Internet2.

Please let me know who from each of your teams will plan to be on the call to share these updates, and any thoughts you have about how to structure this topic.
Thank you,
Nicole

Component Architecture 2024 Series
Steven Zoppi
​
Hi All,
 
We are meeting as scheduled on Monday.  In preparation for that discussion – I’ll ask that you consider the framing below prior to the meeting.
 
IF there is enough time following that discussion – we would like to get any pre-meeting guidance from you all regarding things you believe we should keep top of mind while many of us are interacting at Community Exchange.
 
Agenda
Facilitation: Ananya Ravipati
 
In the previous meeting: Judith, Phil, and the team discussed the impact of tech changes on federated identity and cross-site tracking, focusing on third-party cookies and navigational tracking. They highlighted the need to stay updated on these changes and explore potential solutions outside the standard cookie jar, such as FedCM. The team also discussed the role of the standards process and the potential impact of dropping third-party cookies. They also touched on the importance of communication between the identity provider and the relying party, and the concerns about the impact of third party cookie privacy mitigation measures on their project.
 
That recording is here using Passcode:g$6Y+.$h and will be available until February 28th.

This call will be 🔴 RECORDED for viewing by those participants who cannot attend.
The recording will be available for 14 days.

This week, we will discuss: some of the community sensitivity and response to pricing and some of the implications associated with the community’s reaction to Evolveum’s need to shift their pricing model.  This discussion relates to not only the projects (revenue models) but also those of our catalysts because it underscores the relationships and tensions between open source “philosophy”, long-term sustainability, and (beyond sustainability) the ability to continue to enrich product offerings over time in response to community needs.
 
The challenges we face with the community are different from Enterprise dynamics because in most cases, they are equally constrained by statutory, fixed budgeting that may be set up to two (in some cases, more) years in advance of expenditures.
 
This discussion affects not only Catalysts and Projects funding, but also will provide valuable insights for Internet2/InCommon’s own long-term commitments to provide for our community.
 
This discussion topic will be showcased by Slavek with a recent community experience as the centerpiece of the discussion.  The discussions will be facilitated by Ananya R, with some additional inputs from Keith H, Paul C, Bill K helping to characterize some of the community response and reality. 
 
This meeting will be recorded for use by the participants review and reflection, but will be available primarily for those who are unable to attend.  
 
This meeting will form the basis of the follow-on conversation we intend to have on March 25th, so consider this “necessary knowledge.”
 
Regards,
Steve

Agenda/Minutes Locations
All MEETING MINUTES and meeting documentation are now on a shared G-Drive

*- Suggested Future Topics -*

- (Slavek): documentation focused on use-cases. Currently most of TAP documentation is focused on documenting features. In my opinion people would also appreciate documentation for concrete use-cases; basically combining several features together.

- (Slavek) An academic profile for midPoint (or even for the whole TAP). Meaning having a shared configuration profile, with typical settings that the whole community can share (e.g. schema, basic dashboards, notifications, roles, archetypes and so on).
Futures2 Results and Direction-setting

- FedCM - Service Provider Outreach (Guest Speaker / Calls to Action?)

- Telemetry plugin (BennO)

- Outline of the work that the Shibboleth project has been doing to turn Duo's existing service into a passwordless solution for Shibboleth. There's some potential "tension" there because Duo has their own solution for that which may not be ideal and we don't know exactly how this work might be received by them.  (Scott)

We have not treated the wiki as ‘just the current info’, more for the working and governance groups
Github is great for those 

*- Monday January 29, 2024 Agenda -*

* Steve - Welcome / New Year / Work already under way
* (2023 - carry-forward) Feedback / Additional thoughts about these meetings for the coming year
* Brief Introduction to “Futures 2” findings.
* New “Protocol”: last 5 to 10 minutes of each meeting will identify the next catalyst group or project team to bring a topic to the following session.
* Additional participants may be invited as needed to help propel the discussion (we are doing that today with the Training and Education team).
* We should consider the possibility/opportunity of asking authoritative representatives of Commercial Service Providers who may be interested in presenting to this group, their approach and thoughts about OUR community.
* Advisory Group Framing/Direction: TAC / CACTI / Catalysts
* Cirrus Identity (Mark Rank) / Case Study and Solution Exploration 
 “A new feature in the Cirrus Org-Branded ID service for calling back to an organizational REST service when identities are created or updated in that system.”
* Jean Chorazyczewski and Clara Broomfield - Training direction / Project and Program Partnership (Catalysts and Solution Developers) / Directional Feedback and Reactions

*- Carry forward from last meeting of 2023 -*

* Retrospective and prospective thought about these meetings for 2024
* Forum for members of this group to:
** Create common ground across implementation practitioners and developers
** Give time for discussions on prospective adopter issues/successes and future needs
** Create community input funnel, fit and gaps and get these into solutions’ production pipeline in hopes of having more successful community adoption

*- Monday December 11,2023 -*

Retrospective and prospective thought about these meetings for 2024
Forum for members of this group to:
* Create common ground across implementation practitioners and developers
* Give time for discussions on prospective adopter issues/successes and future needs
* Create community input funnel, fit and gaps and get these into solutions’ production pipeline in hopes of having more successful community adoption

Bill- want to encourage others to do more of the driving of these stories and solutions. Internet2 is wanting to see more from the others. I2 is feeling like we're guessing on the priorities of the work, where do we go from here?  What should be done first? 
Need more conversations from the group

Scott- we were always needing to be our own drivers as input was minimal. Not getting responses and feels like others don't want to discuss. Always need prioritization  help.  Have an ample amount of stuff coming in that keeps us busy. 
Do we need SAML training?

Charise- feels the forums are working, might have had an idea that Unicon was a bit overwhelming in the beginning so did hold back a little. Awareness that there is a lack of participation and want to contribute. Trying to get as many people as we can letting us know what they need and how Internet2 can support you. 

Dave- were here to help you but need to know how we can do that

Laura- concerned on the size of the meeting, is it more of a listening space? 
Could we split the list at the top?

It’s also not completely clear to me of the objective of the meeting - what am I *supposed* to be getting out of this conversation? - yes, the conversation is interesting and more should speak, though what am I trying to get out of this?

Should we be updating the charter?: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JAUwsYNivlJBDOwPTU41jJkBP7vx8pQHOJXmg-_UD2g/edit?usp=sharing

- Input and feedback on the offerings of the InCommon Academy  (Jean)
- What is working well?
- What is not working well?
- What could we do more?
- Where should it go in the future?
- What are you willing to support?  (content, trainers, etc.)

Good morning! 

Today will be our last meeting of the year and we will be asking everyone to contribute both in retrospective and prospective thought about these meetings for 2024.

Although we will record this meeting (as we have previously), participation from as many of you as possible will give us better direction for 2024. +
CSP +
Component Architecture +
Software Integration working group +
CACTI +
TAC +
are also shaping their missions for 2024 so 
we hope you all can have your voices included in these conversations.

Our objective in 2024’s series of meetings is to 
provide a forum in which:
    implementation practitioners and developers can create common-ground
    while giving time for discussions on +
    prospective adopter issues/successes +
    and future needs +

In short: We are focused on 
connecting the “community input funnel, fit, and gaps” to the “solution’s production pipeline” +

in hopes of having more successful community adoption.

Nicole Roy will be our facilitator and we look forward to seeing you all soon!

Happy Wednesday... Tomorrow's team meeting will still take place but I will be unable to attend because of another booking with Howard & Co re:Eduroam - so Sara won't be there either.

I would like to set an agenda for Monday's components meeting (and who the facilitator will be) around the remaining topics from the last meeting INCLUDING

- "forcing function discussion" the participants (Catalysts AND Projects) engage

- get these two sets of constituencies to talk to each other MORE.

I'll try to help frame this better with you all but the goal is as was previously stated: get these two sets of constituencies to talk to each other MORE.

Nicole: Prep during previous day arch planning meeting; any catalyst willing to to a paid gig to help us with telemetry

Imagine a team and a problem set that Evolveum and Grouper team could solve through  collaboration with  CI/SIWG as project owner

    Architecture Group:
        To be a part of Trusted Access Platform, Component Architects and the Catalyst Program, the components, their caretakers, and the community solution providers, are considered to be 'stakeholders' and must demonstrably commit to making the Trusted Access Platform solutions: "coherent, sustainable, and adoptable by our community" as a never changing goal.  
        
        The Component Architects call is a low-cost-to-component-caretakers way to do that. 

        If you (the participants in this meeting) and others want to suggest another way to do that, let’s talk about it.

Chad Redman and Mark McCoy (Unicon)

We welcome them to the group and will ask them to provide us with their insights on the types of needs that they hear voiced by the community (both met, and unmet). (See previous meeting minutes for the backdrop/context of what kinds of stories we are seeking to be shared).

https://documentation.divio.com/[] 

We will then discuss the above: “Documentation/Usability As A Priority”

Documentation: ChrisHy: searching the wiki: space-restricted search by moving Grouper wiki to its own cloud instance; challenge for cross-component materials ('grouper-midpoint' as a tag)

As we have previously discussed, Internet2 is now in the renewal cycle for all agencies, consultants/contractors, and assignees.  Over the years, we have evolved to create consistency across all of our agreements and work assignment procedures.  This year, in the spirit of full transparency, we are also issuing written guidance (currently in Draft form) to help answer questions ahead of the SOW/Work Segment writing phase.

If you currently have a contract/ statement of work with Internet2, you are encouraged to read the document in its entirety.  It is currently a DRAFT, open for comment by all.

- 2024 Statements of Work - Guidance (For Comment) - Google Docs

As members of the component architecture group, your inputs shape the investment priorities Internet2 makes. 

One of the items which will be discussed on Monday are our top 2 priorities:

- Software Quality: Bug Fixes / Break-Fix Tracking (this is *always* our top investment priority – but it is not unlimited)
- Documentation/Usability

The topics of Documentation and Documentation Quality have been identified as significant barrier to adoption, implementation, use, and understanding of suitability of a given solution/component/option - and this is our top priority for 2024-25.

Please note that “New Features,” while always an investment priority, is our lowest priority when compared to the others cited in the guidance document for 2024-25.

Documentation/Usability As A Priority

The Grouper Team has undertaken a quantitative/qualitative approach to surveying community sentiment.  The results of their findings are noted in the bottom of the guidance document, but I’m putting them here as well since this topic will be discussed in the second part of this week’s meeting. 

There are options which we can discuss, but assessing the value/benefits of each option are not solely up to the projects - everyone’s perspectives need to inform the directions undertaken by the projects, and Internet2, for the benefit of our collective community.

we make it complex and community needs simple/coherent story

Keith Hazelton
There’s one kind of complexity that can be addressed, and the other kind that is just intrinsic to the use cases and policies that need to be supported. One variety we could address is the incommensurate terminology from component to component. The terminology overlap between midPoint and Grouper is way smaller than it needs to be.  I’ve started an effort to map midPoint terminology and. functions to something closer to Grouper and to RBAC/ABAC conceptual models.

Steve Zoppi
You're right Keith - THIS is a HUGE barrier to comprehension

Any reconciliation we can get will at least help people who are new(er) not feel completely disoriented.

Keith Hazelto
mP documentation reads like an assembly language manual

Steve Zoppi
LOL, Yes - it does ... and contrary to what Matt was saying - the user interface is PRETTIER - but it's certainly not EASIER for anything but the IAM practitioner.

Keith Hazelton
“I see how you move memory address contents into register X, but how do I get quarterly sales results?

mP docs are much more developer to developer than we generally need

Steve Zoppi
Exactly - I'm not a slouch - and EVERY time I open midPoint, it takes me about 30 minutes to "resurrect" the steps I need to accomplish what I set out to do ... once I remember, it doesn't take a long time - but even figuring out the best way to accomplish a given task in the tool - takes a LOT of familiarity with the down-stream consequences of THAT particular method.

Keith Hazelton
√

Steve Zoppi
especially with midPoint - I can pretty easily screw up someone else's implementation without knowing I did so.

Keith Hazelton
the ridge lines are extremely narrrow
:white_check_mark:
OK, I’ll get back to wrestling with the terminology tar pit
(Um, that sounds like what brer fox said to brer rabbit and that didn’t end well)

- - -
mP less than ideal for out of the box
- Account issuance 
- self-service registration
- id proofing is an unsolved challenge; How are commercial products addressing this?
- Dedra: Main clientele: AD / AzureAD; we're working on a solution; Sailpoint has it's way, none are tailored to HE need.
- the misperception of mP as only a provisioning engine; mP interface is not great for non-tech managed groups; grace period mgmt, etc.

We will continue today with the remaining catalysts and discussions of their stories. 

We welcome the addition of 
Margaret Cullen and 
Kevin Hickey of the CACTI group to our ranks.

They may not make today’s meeting but I am adding them today.

In today’s discussions though, I want to make sure that the primary question to keep in mind is “what are the stories of need expressed by your prospects”, and in the story telling and discussion, the content should not only express what your service/products *can* do, but I’m also seeking where your solutions *may not* meet the full needs – on other words, I want to also understand the *gaps* that you’re hearing about from the prospect/community.

As a reminder:

    This will be our last meeting until October 2nd.
    Starting on that date, we will begin the process of renewing statements of work for all Agency Partners; Independent Contractors/Consultants; Assignees for 2024.
    Heads-up for 2024: Our objectives stated at the beginning of the year (improving/updating documentation; getting the code bases up to date with the current frameworks; getting usability information lined up and preparing to get better telemetry; etc.) have not changed.  Funding from Internet2 will still favor these efforts over those of new feature creation.

Good morning all!

Recapping last week’s message here – we will be continuing the agenda as outlined and we look forward to discussing the real-world stories brought to the virtual floor by our Catalyst partners.  We WILL be recording this call as well due to asynchronous schedules.

In alpha-ish order – the following Catalysts are planning to be present:

    Evolveum (Simona and Slavek)
    Provision IAM (Matt G)
    SCG (Laura / BennO)
    Unicon (JJ / Charise)
    Vantage (Jacqueline P)

There should be more than enough conversation from these participants for today – we will add the remaining Catalyst Partners (and continuing with those we have insufficient time to explore today) in the next meeting.

TechEx is almost upon us!

Steve Zoppi/Internet2
One of the challenges we talked about was the "user friendliness" for non-technical contributors. This *is* a consideration but it is only one of many considerations around some classes/types of documentation. We can raise those questions / discussion points here as well.
This is consistent with our objective of "combing out the cruft" from the existing confluence "heap" ...

Scott Cantor
OSU has a generator that's markdown based and generates Docker-hosted searchable doc sites.
Probably easy enough to adapt to asciidoc minus the search feature I guess.

FWIW, editing tables in Confluence is already terrible and really not any better than editing them in ASCIIdoc

Radovan Semancik
https://github.com/Evolveum/docs/blob/master/_data/midpoint-versions.yml

Steve Zoppi/Internet2
This is true NR - I think that maintaining / managing tables in confluence has become "best done" by "placing a link to a g-sheet".

Scott Cantor
You think tables are bad in standard, cloud is worse.
(unless they inflicted the new editor on local also)

Steve Zoppi/Internet2
HOW can it be worse? (nevermind - rhetorical).

Nicole
Did anyone watch the Apple WWDC keynote? Apparently they use cloud Confluence for internal documentation. Eeek.

        https://github.com/chauth/confluence_http_authenticator/issues/63

    <Slavek> reference information from last meeting:
        Evolveum - has migrated everything to asciidoc - so it can be cross-compiled into any other format.  This creates a layer of abstraction apart from the “WIKI Lock-in” issues. Chief midPoint architect, Radovan Semancik, built this system. 
        Request that Slavek help us bootstrap a prototype of how we can structure documentation, do change management, etc.  (Migration from Confluence to AsciiDoc may be an option).

Ask Dedra (when she is here next), what Cirrus Identity does
Reminder: We are able to help resource various efforts. 
If people need help, reach out to this group.

*- Goal: Migrate TAP Containers from CentOS to Rocky Linux -*
Background:

The end of life dates for CentOS 7 and 8 are as follows:

CentOS 8 - December 31, 2021

CentOS 7 - June 30, 2024

Trusted Access Platform uses CentOS 7 (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/eol/centos-eol-guidance
	
CentOS EOL guidance | Compute Engine Documentation | Google Cloud
cloud.google.com

CentOS 7 and 8 are the final releases of CentOS Linux. 
The end of life dates for CentOS 7 and 8 are as follows:

CentOS 8 - December 31, 2021

CentOS 7 - June 30, 2024

*- Rocky Linux (amd64/arm64) appears to be popular with the Community, do we need further discussion? -*

· Internet2 has been doing some work with Rocky Linux 8.x:

· Grouper built and lightly tested

· Shib SP and IdP built and tested

· midPoint built but not fully tested, Evolveum does not see any big issues

· COmanage remains to be built and tested

· Discussion Points:

· Impacts on component development teams

· Timing and transition and support issues

*- How long would teams need to maintain CentOS versions for support reasons or would this even be an issue? -*

*- Would there be a hard EOL date for TAP containers? -*

· Possible container modifications or pattern changes required and associated documentation

· Community messaging

*- Formalizing the roster of actual product users (by institution) -*

This year - we want to create insight into exactly WHO is using the components and HOW.  That opacity of information needs to be cured.
Training / Advocacy; and documentation mapping/navigation

We have increased synchronization demands between the project’s deliverables and the training functionality / workbenches we need to support.  That means greater determinism in release coordination with the training / CSP functions.

#### Pickup point from previous meeting:
Topic: Resourcing work that needs to complete by or around the end of Q2: How are we going to get it done if there are resource constraints?

Mandatory requirements for test harnesses and automation

As new work is done, we want to ensure that we are building a minimum complement of regression tests / automated build verification work, etc.

Additional topic (since last meeting) which may be germain in this context of shared workflows, CI/CD pipeline, automation: Potential benefits of exploring GitLab versus GitHub enterprise...Getting all projects to a similar/consistent level.

Packaging, distribution and product instrumentation for installation and usage reporting;

  Tools and tooling (I2 is looking at modifying its CI/CD)
  Is there work that one project can pick up for the other?  (Packaging: Evolveum?)

  Trusted Access Platform Document Management (Draft)
Background (from last meeting): Internet2’s Trust and Identity division provides coordination and support for the community-led Trusted Access Platform project to develop, package, and disseminate a suite of Identity and Access Management (IAM) software for the research and education community.

The companion documentation for that software has now grown to a size that a more formal approach is needed for its management. This document is a proposal for the establishment of a Collection of documents that are managed according to the principles and processes outlined here.

LauraP: It would be helpful if the guidance was something like: Audience, level of understanding, general areas (interface, configuration, develoepers), etc Rather than providing guidance that specifies, say, the headers of each section of the  documentation

_2022-09-12 16:20 draft of new comp arch charter_

==== DRAFT for your review / Component Architecture Charter
Steven Zoppi

Hi All,

As promised in previous meetings – I have made an initial pass at encapsulating a charter for the Component Architecture group which now takes into account the dynamics/features/program additions that we have created over the past 5 years together.

Please review and comment prior to the document’s access expiration date of *THIS Friday*,
so I can prepare it for conversation on *Monday*’s component architecture meeting.

I believe that I have captured everything that we’ve discussed but perhaps not.  Because this should be considered a “Draft”, I’m not expecting perfection, but I have tried to make it “reasonably complete and comprehensive”… for a charter document.

All feedback is welcome.  I will check in with each of you (who is not on vacation/leave) prior to Friday but would appreciate any signals from you via whatever mechanism you prefer (slack, e-mail, document comment, etc.)

Thanks All!

Steven Zoppi

Good morning – for the past month (or more) we have discussed the general state of the community, technology, trends we see and areas of specific influence to which we might pay closer attention.  We have asked that you all seriously consider the future (starting with 2023 in this case) where our investments may need to shift in service of the community’s changing needs.

Today – we will close this phase of exploration with summary thoughts from you all about the following.

[Please be prepared to comment and (preferably) summarize your suggestions in written form so we may capture them accurately.  We will conduct this discussion in [more or less] round-robin fashion.  Although we will attempt to capture your observations / requests for subsequent internal discussion in the meeting notes – we request your help in ensuring their accuracy.

NOTE: You will have until Friday, August 12th to provide these inputs.  If there are inputs you would like Internet2 to consider and do NOT want them in the public notes, please address them to szoppi@internet2.edu privately.]

Final pass for this cycle: Investment priorities discussion
Resourcing for routine work
Containers
Training materials
Training Sessions
Documentation
Investing in work needed by the community as viewed by
the Projects and
the Catalysts

Internet2 needs to know what you may need from us from the perspective of either capital or labor for purposes of:

Moving forward on existing initiatives and infrastructure in support of the community
Example Shibboleth UI
Metrics you may need from us about the community to help support your own efforts in delivery of community needs (Joint research/metrics/etc.)

Moving forward on planned but not started projects which we may jointly undertake?
Are there *significant* features/functionalities in your sphere of influence which dovetail well with the Internet2/Incommon set of community needs in which we need to participate, support, communicate, help develop, conduct training, conduct research, provide or house documentation, help convene a subset of the community … other?

ScottC: passkeys/webauthN (https://webauthn.guide/):  getting back to phones as authN mech (Yubikey swerve aside); Unicon better positioned to tackle; coord required to dev API plugs to multiple back-ends. token Mgmt: WebAuthN is not the challenge, it's the big token/reg. mgmt web app. (that's where Duo's $$ come from).  Things that privacyIdea does, but badly.

WebAuthN work on campuses already; Unicon is deeply interested

LauraP: The growing and vibrant OpenScience crowd is surprisingly interested in the underlying tech. ORCID has the data but they don't have a reason to do the id verification etc issues. Maybe a symbiont could surface?

As a continuation to the previous meeting, we will pick up our topics from the following.  In the recap, I’d like to ensure that we all understand the context of, and create some focus where the need expressed can be “infinite/undefined”  (such as “Researcher’s needs”).

The objective of our discussions will continue to help shape the investment priorities Internet2 will underwrite in 2023 (and probably for the next 2 to 3 years).  This is ONE of TWO MORE opportunities to present your “asks” prior to the budget cycle for 2022.   This does not mean we won’t be flexible, but the exercise is intended to help create focus/clarity for the next 18 months of effort.

AnnW: SPs have needs that we haven't considered or addressed.

==== Agenda for Today:

*Reflections and Insights* (recap): Today we will continue discussing last meeting’s insights and opinions about directional indicators you recommend we take.

*“Identity Wallets”* and Self-asserted / portable tokens and attributes.

*More emphasis:*

--  Researchers Needs

--  Self-Sovereignty (to be explored) +

--  Federation 2.0 work. (Refeds working group follow-up work) +

*Federations are not evolving fast enough* to address the needs of the collective constituencies.

-- Need an overarching new model for federations and what they should do. +

-- Widening gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” so federations (smaller or less well-funded) need to rely on others… To what extent should / can that happen. +

-- Reference: The report: _Academic Interfederation into the 2030s_,
acFed-2030s.pdf +

-- See contents of previous meeting for backdrop of discussion +

*Projections and Focal Points*: +
Internet2 is about to begin its budget planning cycle and we would like to hear your thoughts about where our efforts may need to be increased for 2023 and beyond.  Working Groups; Project Needs; Partner Support; etc. +
*Statement from last meeting*: +
If we could focus on an enabling set of work packages - maybe we could assist in propelling the work in these other areas. +
*Question*: +
Which work packages can we undertake/support? +


*Suggested/Requested Direction for this group, and Internet2*:

-- Catalyst Partners?

-- Dev Projects/Principal Architects?

-- Internet2? +

Steven Zoppi: Kick-starter: Telemetry/Heuristics Discussions

Copying: Ann/Romy/Kevin/David for their ongoing awareness.

Today's components call will be a discussion about Telemetry and Heuristics.  We previously talked about Project Documentation.

Before we go any further – I want to note: I’m not asking for anyone to DO anything yet, but you each have specific expertise which enables us to do a “divide and conquer” survey of what we will WANT/NEED to do.  Because this requires community/internal/project development coordination, it’s not going to be easy and will involve a LOT of community conversation/guidance/leadership.  This is an alignment effort for now.

In order for us to move the ball forward on this (now) 6 or 7 year old objective, it's going to require alignment with the projects themselves (as well as the Catalyst Partners).  So this means that each of you will have some type of active role in how that pipeline is created.  Today's "episode" of Component Architecture discussion is the first discussion that will identify each of your respective roles with respect to, and as it relates to, the projects.

We can talk about this a bit more tomorrow but I wanted to begin to frame it up here first.

Each team member's role will look roughly like this (with a primary focus on Project Documentation and Telemetry/Heuristics unless I indicate otherwise).  The person identified will be the RACI "A"ccountable person for the efforts but I fully-appreciate that no person is an island.  We will add this to each of your goals in a way that’s meaningful.

COmanage - Ananya R
Container Instrumentation - Dave S (Nicole)
Data Collection Engine - Mike L
Data Storage/Pipeline/Visualization - Thomas P
Eduroam - Sara J
Federation Manager statistics and heuristics - Nicole R
Grouper - Chris H
Internal Application Statistics - IJ (Mike L)
Shibboleth (UI, SP, IdP) - Paul C
Work Coordination - Bill K

I am also asking that Keith H provide his support in harvesting requirements, qualifying them, and prioritizing/engaging the community conversations (both through the existing working groups or perhaps the creation of a different channel) – this will help us test our thinking.  Keith’s expertise and support may be required for your areas as well.  David Walker has already been working on the “Framing” of how we might want to approach Project Documentation.

This is a STARTING point for discussion but the framing helps distribute the load and create focus.

Good morning – we will pick up our discussions where we left off last meeting

==== (Discussions amongst ourselves)  Succession planning is the next big subject to pursue.

For each of the projects (and persistent working groups), please

` identify who your respective “stand-in” will be/should be (if one exists), and
` if not – we’d like to help figure out who that should be and quasi-formalize that relationship.
` This is a discussion that involves everyone because the right answer may or may not be
`  “a person” – but perhaps
`  one of the catalyst partners.

EthanK, KeithL, RichardF, BenR, TommyD

Even if we don’t get to a clear conclusion –
I’d like to know how we help serve as “back-ups” for each other.

==== Following (and related to) that,

it would be helpful to get context of where the projects stand with respect to their own roadmaps and priorities.

We will be picking up the documentation conversation and discussing some of the topics from the CACTI conversations +
– David Walker will be joining us to talk about queueing up the work and helping us narrow down a (potential) common structure.

==== documentation issues
The notes from last week’s meeting describes the current state of project level documentation.  There are a number of “nagging questions” that we will have to resolve

` “What to do with/about confluence in the future?”  The current gravity seems to be “leave it alone”

` per Scott’s experience, if we have to move away from Datacenter (or if Atlassian moves us away from it) +
` > plug-ins will become virtually unusable +
` > some content may need to be stripped of them +

==== Some nagging questions:

`   Do we even have the right tool for the job? +
`   Should we continue to invest there? +
`   How can/should we reduce our dependence on the plugins or even the product itself? +
`   Is our first step “Reduce the amount of content in Confluence by Archiving it.”? +
`   Should we be borrowing documentation techniques from each other to fill in those blanks?

==== And finally:

` What should the “top level navigation” look like +
` which leads to the project repositories and +
` what should ALL the project document repositories share in common so the top level navigation can be consistent?

Looking forward to continuing this conversation. -- Steve

b.   Reference architectural patterns (and therefore, our training, containers, etc.).

Putting a stake in the ground will enable Dedra (along with the rest of us) to proceed on our next documentation/planning steps.
Carry-Forward:

Successors/New Talent/Catalyst Partnerships

The Future Engagement / Support Model

For Architecture: Who are the successors going to be?  How do we identify/develop them?

Is Agency (Consultancy) “the Future”?

IdPro- certification in the works, opportunities there,

What are campuses actually DOING to conserve/promote/identify talent?
 - Seems like a CACTI/Global Summit conversation

- - -

On yesterday’s call – we covered a dizzying array of matters that affect the projects, the partners and the community.

Because it’s hard to get clarity with that range of topics – I thought I’d re-frame it a bit more tightly.  I began with the objective of “Planning for 2022”.

In planning for 2022, this is a time of reflection regarding “how we are doing” and “what we are doing”.

The easy part is in making the decision to clean up some “debt” in the backlogs … we all generally know what we need to do there – so it’s a parallel process.  And it’s largely “low hanging fruit”.

While it feels like we covered a wide-range of considerations, what we’re trying to resolve is where Internet2’s boundaries/limits must be drawn in responsibility for, and applying resources to:

Communication with the community in all its forms: training/education, community-related issues, and features/functionality.
Underwriting elements of the project work in a “most benefit first” sense (where: *“Most Benefit” is determined through the sum of the channels of CACTI, TAC, PAG and CSP participants)*.

Historically, there have been a number of community requested component features which have been sponsored by Internet2 (on behalf of the community).  In the end, the projects themselves have enjoyed broad discretion about which features are created.  That’s generally worked well and we are now at a good window of opportunity to evaluate whether or not the previous course of investment/priorities remains correct for the future.

It was also mentioned today that CACTI (and others) would like to have a better perspective on what the road ahead looks like for each of the projects so they too, can calibrate how well we are meeting the needs of the community.  Others are also asking the same questions at the institutional level so they too, can plan to use community solutions, and determine if they need to seek other, perhaps complementary offerings.  This is clearly something that Internet2 will need to collect and (somehow) help visualize – but we can’t (currently) do all of it for all of the projects in support of all of the options given current resource constraints.  So we have to determine how much we can and should try to accomplish.

Because there is no coherent way of representing the above (yet, but it’s on our list), Internet2 can only document how the gap/fit of solutions and service offerings meets the needs of Internet2’s community (as we understand them).  Moreover, there exists overlap with the needs of International users (who aren’t part of the Internet2 community directly), but to the extent that those needs do not overlap, the question arises as to whether or not the projects themselves should determine how those solutions meeting the needs outside of Internet2’s community will be resourced – this includes both direct funding and labor investment.

Herein is the dilemma for the Architecture group.  We have to first define what the limits of our investment *can* be (as one aggregated body of: Internet2, the projects, and the partners).  This will inform our priorities as a group.  It will also inform how we communicate about those investments.  Then we can make decisions/move in a direction that provides as much of a TOTAL benefit as possible.

So yes – the conversation can be very (perhaps painfully) abstract especially when considering the dynamics and relationships between all of the stakeholders.  But as mentioned; Internet2 isn’t “selling solutions” … we are facilitating them.  Last time I checked, “facilitation” is not easy work.  Nor is architecture.

We can’t be all things to all people, so we may as well be deliberate about “what we are,” and “to whom.”

I hope that brings better context to what, precisely, we’re trying to sort out for 2022.  It will take more conversation.  It’s a process.  Your insights are welcome.

Good morning – as we approach CAMP/ACAMP – I think it would be a good idea for us to sync-up on the current state of the components and their evolution.  What do we want to talk about in the CAMP/ACAMP context, and what do we NOT want to talk about in that context?

Charise won’t be joining us this week but I still want to take time to cover as much as we can.  Also I’d like CACTI / TAC Playback from the co-membership on the conversations there about “documentation” “packaging” etc…

Good morning – we will be picking up our conversation where we left off last time.  For those who couldn’t make it, we will recap prior to the discussion.

T and I - Component Architects (2021) - Google Docs

The above document also has a (temporary) link to the partial recording from last week (for our consumption only) – the link will be removed following today’s meeting and is only there as a memory-jogger/preamble in case anyone wants to refer to it.

Questions remaining from the last conversation:

- Are we sure that Rocky is going to be supported? Have longevity?
- will remain open?
- Should take a look at POSI as a guideline for infrastructure:
  https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/
- Limits of Internet2’s responsibility / capacity / duty versus that of the projects themselves.
- International users / considerations of their support for I18N?
- Proposed Objective: Having a UNIFIED and/or Consistent Container Roadmap across projects
- CNCF (cloud native computing foundation)?
- Docker -> Kubernetes -> ?
- Language Bindings / Dependencies for each supported environment?
- QA/Test Automation Considerations / Limitations
- Where does Internet2’s work (and the projects) end and the catalyst partners’ begin?

A discussion point mentioned by Michael Gettes at the end of the last meeting may be taken up by the midPoint team following this meeting:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a11upzjer_QaECOSTKMQRBtP-m06ZNxc-aJca0YBIjI/edit?usp=sharing

- to build a midPoint connector to create an identity table (or a subject source in grouper terminology) out of midPoint

Looking forward to the continued conversation.

'“Privacy, decentralization, and trustworthiness are very difficult to achieve at the same time.

*Blockchains* make *privacy* difficult,

*decentralization* makes it difficult to identify *trustworthy credentials*,

and various chokepoints in the ecosystem might very well mean that

*access* to these technologies ends up going through *centralized portals*,”

says Emin Gün Sirer, a computer scientist and codirector of Cornell University’s Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts.

"But more importantly, these technologies require a rethinking of the notion of identity. And it's here where most enterprises falter, as their

*business models* are inherently tied to knowing and *monetizing every bit of data* about their users."

We will be meeting at the usual time today.  The recap of the items (as best as I could distill them) from the last meeting are now inserted into the running notes document.

CACTI and TAC and CSTAAC - cloud services technology and architecture committee (Net+)
- - - -   https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=154766601

Please have a look at the

. “Recap of Last Meeting” and
. “Proposed Direction” sections

since we will (A) clean up any errors I made in summarization and (B) build upon that for the remainder of our discussions today.

If we are in agreement about the concepts of how to proceed with the architectural “layers”, then we can move on to discussions about how to best manage these layers.

Specifically:
. Discussion of a more formal governance model

 for all ‘traits in common” we define for containers, and the constituent elements within them.

 The assumption is that we will limit the cases we support with boundaries that say “after this, it’s up to the implementer”.  Reflecting on last week’s conversation, this primarily identifies the need for managing Layers One and Two in the model description.

Regards,
Steve

*Two Minimal Viable Workbenches (MVWs)*
(essentially simplified versions of existing CSP workbench)
```
1) COm + subjSource + Grouper + Shib
or
2) mP  + subjSource + Grouper + Shib

Configuration option to include a set of pre-populated person entities, or not

That would already be enough to demonstrate IAM features up to provisioning access policies for Grouper users
```

*Logical first step beyond MVW*

```
Wire a System of Record to COm or mP
1) TAP-provided mock SIS and/or HR
or
2) Real SoR selected by campus, an SOR with which TAP has previously integrated.
Allows for full-fledged lifecycle management and access policy definition and enforcement
```

*Logical second step beyond MVW*

```
Set up (de-)provisioning to a campus system or service with which TAP knows how to integrate
using COmanage, Grouper, and/or midPoint as provisioning engine
```

*Augment MVP.2 to include COmanage as a system of record for guests*

Dedra:AD as cred store, bridge to fed
gateway for social credentials


#### Today’s discussion will focus on

*finalizing the scope / limits / boundaries of our reference architectural patterns*

(and therefore, our training, containers, etc.).  Putting a stake in the ground will enable Dedra (along with the rest of us) to proceed on our next documentation/planning steps.

I would also like to discuss

*a more formal governance model for all ‘traits in common':*

we define for containers, and the constituent elements within them.  The assumption is that

*we will limit the cases we support with boundaries that say “after this, it’s up to the implementer"*

While it is the case that we want to do as much up-front work as possible for the community, we are now faced with needing to build consistent support

*to reduce complexity (in the form of training/education, and reference works)*

Establishment of more formal governance is also in response to feedback and remaining questions after the most recent training retrospective for which we will get more complete feedback from Erin when she is ready.

As a side note - I would like to get your thoughts about this article.  I have strongly-held opinions about blockchain implementations (both for and against) but would like to see if any of you sees the touch-points in this implementation that are likely to affect our work directly:

https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-decentralized-id-blockchain/

"...various chokepoints in the ecosystem might very well mean that access to these technologies ends up going through centralized portals,” says Emin Gün Sirer, I just fundamentally doubt that the breakthrough we need can come from a centralized software vendor."

Steve

*thoughts*

See scribing doc

*Agenda*

Good morning – we will continue our discussions

‘taxonomy’ of institution/installation types

and start the process of aligning around which parts of the solution base should participate in the story for each of those.

We have 5 models for the internal IAM architectural patterns for integrating different functional components:

https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/COmanage/COmanage+midPoint+Integration+Approaches

Background.

A common question amongst the InCommon Community has been the relationship between COmanage and midPoint.
There is no one exact answer to this question, +
as with many integration problems the best answer for a given deployment will depend on the circumstances of that deployment.

For today’s discussion – I hope to leverage your collective debate skills and experience to describe how we stratify our thinking:

Discussion: Describe Three to (no more than five) existing institutional patterns that you’re aware of, in ascending order of complexity based on YOUR perception

(Least Complex)
.
.
.
(Most Complex)

What requirements drive the need to migrate to the next level of complexity? +
Do the 5 models (linked above) agree with the patterns identified in the discussion?

Following the demonstration of the SandBench/WorkBox at the last meeting, today’s discussion will be about identifying the ‘canonical’ patterns and prototypical institutional targets so we can begin the process of

- identifying the limited number of architectural examples
  that we will adopt for training/documentation/use case categorization, etc.

- regarding IDPoLR we wanted to continue this discussion (and cover a few other items)

-   architectural  patterns that can be used to express how the proxies fit into the ecosystem
-   seems we should confine things to a finite # of containers and patterns that we are definitive about but let others help with extended/different patterns that institutions desire, refer them to Catalyst partners etc to help with their specific needs
-   compromise is to define proxy patterns
-   Dedra-maybe consider putting one or more proxies in the sandbench- our responsibility to describe them as a catalyst
-   3 patterns that we maintain (no more than 5)

Bert session; ABAC via loader jobs without creating all the intermediary groups that are typically involved. Should be possible to set up

Chris Hy - good defaults, and it shouldn't take a lot of time; Getting at and editing config files and certs; Well chosen ui driven Env Vars could make things much easier in the 80/20 case

- - -
Today we will recap, and capture for future discussions in the run-up to 2021, some of the highlights from CAMP/ACAMP which may be actionable for us.

Please give a bit of thought to themes *you* noted for inclusion in today’s discussions – I will be ‘polling’ everyone for highlights / themes which you each found particularly interesting (or perhaps, not interesting).

The first part of today’s meeting will be getting *your* synthesis of *what you all heard during CAMP/ACAMP of particular note to our 2021 efforts*.

Among the topics in which I participated (and in reading the notes from the other sessions I could not attend)…. There were some themes which weren’t necessarily “new” but they were definitely “different” this year.

There was much discussion around “*Reference Architectures*” and some aspirational language about what should be done by working groups (and Internet2) for the community writ-large.  Much of the language (in panels and breakouts) at C/AC revolved around:

* Defining architectural ‘templates’ which confine the choices that institutions would have to make to establish a working IAM environment that comports with “Best Practices”.

** At the same time – there were parallel discussions about the fact that the diversity of integration needs is broad and creates tension with that aspirational goal of getting closer to ‘one size fits all’.

* OIDC Feels the same as it felt last year to me.  After re-reading the section notes from ACAMP, I’m not sure whether or not there is a “Displacement of SAML” or just “Expansion of OIDC”.

* An increasing need for Training and Workshops, but a decrease in the number of people who can handle the aggregate workload due to institutional pressures amplified by COVID and campus responses to the pandemic (in general).

* There was a bit of discussion around the “Federation Adapters” topic which is interesting as an directional option (perhaps) to some of the tensions described above.  When Dedra is able to join us, we will explore this topic more fully- but I want to tee up the topic here.



… and more.

===== Agenda Bash - Call for Additional Topics

===== Shib SP Future
Getting our heads around the future of the Shibboleth Service provider and what messaging / discussions we should prepare to have... (What future messaging should we prepare ourselves for in the context of TechEx; Webinars; Training; etc.)

This WILL be an ACAMP topic...

ScottC: <We NEED to talk about this> C++ SP & libraries will wither when Scott leaves the picture; He expected mod_oidc to take its place, but it's not happening; So think of re-architecting as a lightweight proxy ala Satosa, SimpleSAMLPhp or a hub agent...

Shib SP is heavily used esp. in commercial products; Designed to be pluggable and replaceable;

Demand for Apache and IIS hasn't gone away, but it involves coding in C.

ScottC: mod_oidc + the ability for IdP to work w SAML metadata; support proxy / hub and spoke "gateway"-ish; Not necessarily co-located, but a REST call to a remote something

Satosa is the closest to supporting a federateable OIDC RP

https://www.mod-auth-openidc.org/
https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/releases -> "OpenID Connect Relying Party implementation for Apache HTTP Server 2.x"
https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/wiki -> FAQ (see excerpts immediately below)

Take a look at the (simple) examples in the README.md first:
https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/blob/master/README.md
For an exhaustive overview of all configuration options, see:
https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/blob/master/auth_openidc.conf

Here are some walkthrough articles on the web for a configuration against Google:
https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/wiki/Useful-Links

If mod_auth_openidc is passing things in headers they should be warned off

Shib philosophy was to have two processes on same host. to minimize cognitive and technical load

Dedra: client using Amazon Cognito (no encryption, not federateable); SAML SPs are deeply entrenched, so a bridge from OIDC OP to SAML SP will be valuable for a Loooong time.

===== CAMP/ACAMP Expectations / BOF Discussion

BOFs as in-person events are not in near-term future, but the opportunities can be replicated in other modes and media.

How is ACAMP gonna work?  Similar to old except Zoom: No recording, so scribing is critical; Agenda building, 5 rooms; pres + open discussion.

===== Project Status and Next Steps

Shibboleth UI (Follow-Up from Last Meeting)
Next Steps doc online ( updated  link)  everyone should be able to comment
Scott: we are moving toward moving more to properties vs xml which will have an impact and maybe an opportunity
Note that the documentation has been updated recently and we would appreciate comments

Federation Manager

COmanage Agency Onboarding / Considerations / "Steering Committee" progress

Atlassian A'-po-cal'i-pa'-ssian: NO on-prem, will be cloud-only in 2024; pricing options benefit open source and non-profits; Horrendous: email based domain claim so if osu.edu is registered, you inherit all .edu emails; hard part is proxying email into internet2 and route back to Jira. Unfederated, i2 local accounts would solve this, but doesn't

Evolveum/midPoint
+ midPoint 4.2 is GA and will be used in the midPoint training in early December; IDE will likely be new midPoint Studio (based on IntelliJ community edition; Both midPoint 4.2 and midPoint Studio pre-release versions are in trial use by TAP.
Evolveum is at work on a native Shib WebSSO configuration option for midPoint 4.2+; Goal is to be incorporated into CSP Workbench codebase in time for January 2020 Workbench roll-out to CSP participants

InCommon Trusted Access Platform

===== For Future Discussion:

Consolidating the Backlog / Request management

The projects still enjoy separate / parallel activities (midPoint; COmanage; Grouper; Shibboleth; and in containerization, etc...) but it's not necessarily creating better focus when cross-component dependencies and UX/Workflow issues.

We are hitting ‘chicken-and-egg’ deadlocks that we need to break to get faster forward progress.

Proposed solution for discussion: SELECTIVE “centralized” backlog management (containing only the ‘blocker list’)

*Agenda Bash - Call for Additional Topics
*Updates - add yours below:
**  CACTI- current topics and/or any related input from InCommon TAC (Tom J/Nic)
Recap of a few highlights from last week's conversation and follow on conversation about a direction building upon "institutions that want to be involved in InCommon, but don't know what they need."; "Having reference architectures to address the other smaller school models is important - align these with the three models in the IdPaaS WG"; and other comments from last week.
*  Discussion of Selected Items from a recent Analyst report, the Community "reality" discussed last week and Internet2's own dynamics in response to today's reality.
** Excerpts from Analyst Report:
*** _Cross-Train IAM Specialists_ if your firm has separate teams for supporting and operating workforce, business partner, and customer identity and access management (IAM) solutions, now is the time to cross-pollinate IAM knowledge across these silos and investigate ways to exploit synergies.
*** _Plan for IAM Vendor Consolidation_ in a recession, access to venture capital can become much more challenging, causing early stage IAM (and also general security) vendors to go out of business. in response, security and risk (S&R) pros need proactive planning and total cost of ownership calculations of your entire IAM vendor portfolio to mitigate the effects of vendor consolidation or dissolution
** But these are also followed by:
*** _Consolidate your IAM product set._ The global IAM market is highly fragmented with 200 to 250 different vendors that address multiple IAM capabilities, ranging from MFA, single sign-on (SSO), to identity management and governance. IAM suite vendors such as Broadcom/CA, ForgeRock, IBM, and Ping identity provide a broader portfolio of capabilities that cover a lot, but have functionality gaps and usability issues, especially for modern architectures (cloud, microservices, etc.), meaning that forced vendor consolidation is going to be painful.  Suite vendors such as Broadcom/CA, ForgeRock, IBM, and Ping identity provide a broader portfolio of capabilities that cover a lot, but have [analyst firm] estimates that 10% to 15% of IAM vendors will go out of business in the next 24 to 36 months.
*** Specifically - T&I is considering a response this conflicted recommendation and other assertions of this report:
*** "Don’t overreact and switch to open source as a quick budget fix. With capacity increase imperatives, firms have to invest in commercial off-the-shelf [Commercial, Off-the-Shelf] solutions; temporarily using open source software may seem lucrative to alleviate the short-term budget crunch, but over a span of two or more years, support and upgrade costs will inevitably be higher than using [Commercial, Off-the-shelf] software."

Agenda Items:

*  Use a GitHub pages feature on a repo in github.internet2.edu to support an OID, URN, URL, DOI, spec, schema and other namespace landing pad? (KeithH)
** id.incommon.org? id.internet2.edu? Both?
* CACTI- current topics and/or any related input from InCommon TAC (Tom J/Nic)
* Identity and Access Management form smaller institutions - pros and cons of at least two different models (and check in with those in the know about how the various models are working in the real world)
** Unicon/"Liberate" style as-a-service offerings
*** IdP as-a-Service working group output and how it relates - IdP is only a single part of the puzzle
**** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n3TABHJiNnwXlhUSdC18J70qSn_gx4W1xpqMIZUW29o/edit?usp=sharing
** Schools setting stuff up themselves/running it themselves
** Underlying stuff needed to make a coherent IAM program at a smaller school work - many of our components address these needs, but how can we make them easier for smaller schools to adopt
*** Setting up an IAM program is more than just the components - it's a lot of business analysis/process/policy - how necessary is that for smaller schools?

Other things like starting a container as a non-root user and other OS support among them.  Chris Hubing started a page to begin to address things here https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/x/cgEOCg

*Pickup on this thread to flesh-out this idea of what constitutes the "Low Bar" for Integration
**(From Last week)- A low bar way to identify if other components are involved.  Out of the box there is connectivity, simple model , match component is built behind the api that they are working on ,  right now admin just clicks a box. +1 ChrisHy (Could have sub classes)

Pandit Ashish, ITANA list, 27 Feb 2020:

 info: For people who might be interested in reviewing stacks of other institutes use, there are 2 sites I have come across

 https://stackshare.io/ and https://builtwith.com/

 Both are good sites. I didn’t see too many higher ed institutes on their list. However, it is a good platform for documentation.

 We currently have around 20+ developers ,  80+ integrations on Nifi platform. I am planning to present this in one of the future API meeting once our platforms are stabilized.

Good Morning,

Our first meeting for 2020 will be held this morning and here is today’s starting agenda.
There is more here than we will be able to fully cover but this meeting is intended to
“prime the pump” and tee up agenda topics for the next few meetings.

**  Federation Manager

* “Herding the Cats” with an integrated Dashboard*
 **   APIs: "We have a master backlog of features and functions that we need"; coherent, warranted, not just everything that's ever been mentioned
 **   How-tos: Now that GDG is in confluence, the how-to bits can be appendixes to the Deployment Guides
 **   Fed Mgr tweaks to support Baseline V2;
 **   Test federation: working with InC-TAC to scope and define
 **   IdPaaS report may have implications

*  "On The Radar" - 2020 Formalizing Collaborative Development and Project Funding Opportunities*
**  NIH/NIAD
**  GEANT
**  SURFNET
**  Other?

*  Corporate Program, Jessica: Create s'thing like an affiliate/partner membership; conditions and benefits;

*  2020 will feel somewhat like spiraling back to Year 1 focus on Community: Adoption, Outreach, Requirement gathering, Training...

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Regards, Steve

Ana Hunziger: Community Engagement

Ron's tool: see spreadsheet "heat map"

CE is  evolving towards doing more  full academic engagement (including
faculty, researchers and research support staff) much more rapidly than
the rest of the organization. There are some efforts to get there but we
need to make more forward progress beyond CE. The will is there but it’s
also about changing culture and culture assimilation.

I2 is not just the network; CIOs still want lots above the network. It's just a utility, and it works, so they're not terribly interested.

smaller schools: Rollout of Academy lit the group up; how to bring them into the national arena.

Looking for engagement around Research, IAM tools

researchers on board; Jim Bottom kitchen cabinet; meanwhile we hired Dana and threw her off the deep end.  Nat'l Research Platform; Has allowed Ana

1 on 1 with researchers doesn't scale; coordination and communication; start with an identified handful; don't have a really good integrated story about what I2 offers researchers;

Dana charged to form a team whose 1st task is defining a mission

Take stock of what we mean by 'the members'

Is there a vision beyond a world divided into members and non-members, can we reframe 'stakeholder'

challenges internally to be able to pull this off

Imagining changing structure across I2, start with CE and TI, then MarComm (new web home), Events,...

Ana's thing 1 and 2:
- workforce xformation: are we paying enough attention: what talent is coming online and how do we relate? Should I2 be in this space;
- Internet2 brand: What will/should our brand be in 20 years?

CE has a retreat coming up soon--will TI be involved?

_2019-08-05 09:55 Comp Arch Meeting_

LAST WEEK we identified that the work we are doing with respect to our packaging approach and general support activities serving the use cases of the domestic US community is directionally correct.  The “What we’re doing,” in effect, was discussed.  The “Who could be doing it” part of the discussion was punted until we had more representation from the agency partners and independent consultants. Today we will be discussing (as forecasted in the previous meetings):



==== How to best reference / leverage / engage commercial partners
This includes topics of potentially increasing / formalizing:

·**   Ongoing Community Support

·**   Training / Education / Services Offerings

**   Shibboleth UI
**   hibboleth SP
**   Shibboleth IdP
**   Grouper
**   COmanage
**   midPoint

The following will be our topics for today’s call:

*  Discussion regarding the cross-component issues the InCommon architecture team is wrestling with regarding
**   UI placement,
**   feature overlap, and
**   user experience simplification.

- - -

On the last
component architecture call, on the topic of architectural frameworks, we briefly discussed proxy solutions and how they might fit into the “core” and “non-core” recommended technologies.

The agenda made a note about SaToSa and I mentioned over email that I thought there would be value in including SimpleSAMLphp into the conversation. A few more thoughts on that:

We see consistent use cases for proxy solutions when learning about campus IAM stacks. The primary use cases I come across are:

1) SPs that do not support multilateral federation and need a single SAML IdP
endpoint in situations where campuses want to present multiple identity provider options in discovery

2) Situations where campuses want to integrate third party identity providers
like social login where a proxy can translate protocols and re-map attributes

As the InCommon Trusted Access Platform expands to include use cases around guest access and other use cases where proxies are helpful, it makes sense to me that proxies become part of the ITAP

When it comes to open source proxies, it seems like SimpleSAMLphp and SaToSa are the most widely adopted. Maybe there are others I don’t know about?

I understand the desire not to have an endless sprawl of solution options for ITAP, and to keep recommended architectures
as simple and digestible as possible. At the same time, I think it’s important to acknowledge that both SSP and SaToSa solutions are already deployed in the field, and it would be helpful to provide reference architectures that clearly demonstrate how existing SimpleSAMLphp and SaToSa implementations connect to the ITAP.

I am less familiar with SaToSa, but can speak a bit to SimpleSAMLphp adoption. SimpleSAMLphp is deployed at many campuses in the US, and is extremely widely deployed in Europe. I know it is used for a range of use cases, from supporting an entire country’s federated authentication, to enabling
federation for specific applications at specific universities. From what I can tell, there are many SimpleSAMLphp deployers who also use other “core” ITAP components.

There are a variety of deployment patterns that I have seen:

*  Some campuses roll their own SimpleSAMLphp instances

*  Some campuses hire consulting vendors like Unicon to set up their SimpleSAMLphp instances and add custom capabilities

*  Others subscribe to hosted SSP solutions like those offered by Cirrus Identity

There have been successful partnerships already between local deployers and vendors. For example, the University of Illinois via the Big Ten Academic Alliance contracted with Cirrus Identity to develop a Google OIDC module for SimpleSAMLphp (SSP).

Since then, Cirrus Identity has maintained and expanded that module on its own, adding support for LinkedIn, Microsoft Graph and experimental support for Yahoo. The Cirrus maintained SSP OIDC module has been downloaded over 700 times. Cirrus Identity is now also maintaining the CAS auth module for SSP.

Given the broad adoption of SSP as a proxy solution in both the US and Europe, I would think Internet2 would want to include SimpleSAMLphp at least as a “gray” component in ITAP reference architectures, because then all those extant implementations that integrate SSP with core ITAP components like Shibboleth and Grouper would be instantly part of the family of integration patterns that can be documented and shared with the community. This documentation could also encourage users of SSP to add other ITAP components to solve specific identity challenges.

Those are my thoughts for now.   --Dedra

_2019-04-29 12:00 Comp Arch CCall_

* Bill Kaufman [17:41]*
Hi @sjzoppi, hope you are having a great weekend.  Just wondering what you want me to cover beside the

*  Portfolio
*  status of the Trusted Access Platform
*  discussion around team(s) (CACTI, PAG, etc) reviewing at the top level.
*  Keith and I: How we
**   review the TAP backlog on a regular basis and
**   report work in progress back to the team.

* Steve Zoppi [17:45]*
all of those are actually what I had in mind ... i will try to  be on the top of the call (but in the car) ... and I want to

*  introduce Laura Paglione to the group
*  BennO describe LPs new role.

* Bill Kaufman [17:46]*
ok cool, we should get that in first as the other discussion could likely expand

* Steve Zoppi [17:47]*
yes

* Bill Kaufman [21:39]*
hey again @sjzoppi, just got blown away by Game of Thrones…. but
okay for me to give a

*  shout out to Unicon for the webinar and helping us kick the Shib UI into gear?

want to keep protocol but I think it works well in a couple ways

* Steve Zoppi [21:41]*
I needed to follow up with you separately about that - We’re trying to ensure that Unicon is driving the bus for the moment to get acceptance - so YES I think it’s appropriate to encourage them for a good job.

* Steve Zoppi [21:47]*
And this week - we need to

*  get ALL of the artifacts from folks by Wednesday in preparation for the Denver meeting.

So that’s something I’m going to need your help with while I’m in these meetings ...

* Steve Zoppi [21:57]*
(And while I am addressing Bill in this particular exchange - I can also use YOUR help

  *  Keith: see what I’m looking for in the #i2-Denver-20190507 channel)

I’m counting on the two of you (primarily) to help me keep the wheels on that bus while I’m engulfed in these other meetings this week.

* Keith Hazelton [21:58]*
Will work with Bill on these items

* Steve Zoppi [22:02]*
Thanks to you both - and if you are unable to assist, Please let me know - I know you BOTH have a lot of stuff on YOUR plates as well.

I’m just ‘requesting help’ as in “Those who ask for help at Hogwarts ...” (can you tell I’ve recently watched a Harry Potter marathon?)

* Keith Hazelton [22:06]*
:owl:

* Steve Zoppi [22:08]*
Ahhhh you found my message owl... Thank you .... he needs to be fed.

* Bill Kaufman [09:11]*
For today’s meeting I want to

*  mention the InCommon Website going live
*  inclusion of the Trusted Access Platform at a top level
*  planning work for Portfolio

All seem to beg the question of the Component Projects starting to reference the Container Packages directly.  This has recently been an issue with Grouper where someone has been struggling and the Container would have been much easier.

Not to say that COmanage and Shibboleth would not also have their normal software paths, but at this time I don’t believe they reference our Package Release page at all.   - thoughts?

Steve Zoppi [12:57]
how's this conversation working for you from a 'start the depth of the conversation' perspective?
(i'm postponing the working group discussion until JAJ and BillK can be present)

Keith Hazelton [12:57]
right
sorry, “start the depth” of which conversation?

Steve Zoppi [12:58]
'telemetry'
'instrumentation'
sorry - my question is time-lagging the ACTUAL conversation :slightly_smiling_face:

Keith Hazelton [12:59]
ah, I think we did drill through the crust of our former limited thought to fresh new magma below. A few sentence summary would be handy to have

Steve Zoppi [13:00]
fair enough ...
some of it is that I'm kinda baiting the naysayers...

Keith Hazelton [13:01]
it

Steve Zoppi [13:01]
but not in a mean-spirited way.

Keith Hazelton [13:01]
is working
(the bait)
I thought ScottC’s remarks left room for accommodation
another crawl, walk, run story?
notice the conversation is continuing in #tier-grouper

Steve Zoppi [13:05]
perfect...
scottc tends to think in terms of "where we've been" and not "where we're going"
that's not as true of Chris Hy and BennO though...
so it's (first) an attempt to surface what the "gaps" are in understanding the whole picture's end game (that's what I was starting to attempt in today's call) ... The next step is to level-set everyone on what the destination NEEDS to be - and comb out any of the extraneous cruft.
I'm on another call doing a COmanage demo with chris, paul, sara but I'm going to be enlisting your thinking on the topic we explored this morning and a few others.  The API discussion (re SCIM2.0, etc.) is going to be our next 'internal education' because it seems like that may be a gap as well.

Keith Hazelton [13:12]
good. On SCIM2, if the only real driver is BennO not wanting to code to an older standard, maybe we should reexamine the priority question
I’ll try to assess market adoption and support for SCIM 2 in the meantime

Steve Zoppi [13:13]
agreed - the challenge is that we have to have consistency - that's first and foremost.
(for a core)

Keith Hazelton [13:15]
Thanks for bringing me into conversations like this.

Steve Zoppi [13:17]
No thanks necessary - it is * I*  who should be thanking * you*  - this shit is making my head hurt in trying to 'make simple' something that is (to me) enormously complex because of the asymmetrical dynamics and perspectives.
I'm grateful for your help.

Keith Hazelton [13:18]
in my dad’s machine repair shop we used to joke about needing a box expander
(and of course, a bigger hammer)

Steve Zoppi [13:18]
amen... it's really no joke is it (after all)

Keith Hazelton [13:19]
nope

Hi All,

The call will be held as scheduled and we will pick up where we left off last week with our discussion about

- apprenticeship/successorship planning.

As covered in that conversation, it will take a long time to do this and we need

- focus on it (minimally) starting with TechEx.

Because this will likely take well into 2019, I’d like to get your

- ideas on
  - how to / who to engage in the community or with agency partners
  - to ensure that we can provide the appropriate incentives for everyone.

Some of this conversation

- may be in the context of Campus success program,
- may require engagement with international audiences or
- may require that we take a different approach altogether.

We will also get working group updates from Packaging; API; Data Structures; Dev team status and important milestones approaching, etc.

Looking forward to talking to you all then!

Regards,
Steve

We * will*  be holding this coming component architecture meeting on Monday as scheduled!

Although I will be at TNC (and unable to conduct the meeting), Keith and Bill have graciously volunteered to guide the conversation. (Thanks Guys!)

The general topics to be covered are:

Post-Global Summit
•	We will cover (in a bit more detail) the GS2018 Presentation to the TIER Investor group showing relative investment today and future.
•	NB: Funding for each component includes its packaging
•	We will also cover some Comanage patterns that we will need to anticipate for this year
o	COManage <-> Grouper Conversation Pattern
o	COManage <-> midPoint Conversation Pattern
•	Evolveum/midPoint work in progress
•	General Spending Trajectory (Part I: Remainder of Investor Funding / Part II: Ongoing funding (post-Q1 2019).)
•	Shibboleth UI – “Campus Extensible / Campus Deployable” (This is the "focus" message for this pass of the Shibboleth UI so we can start promoting adoption)

Thanks to everyone for getting the community re-engaged regarding funding and keeping the good work on track.

Regards,
Steve

show ramp-down projections: right proportions are being followed; factor out new development work as of EoY 2018. Onging is covered from them on.
- Contrib to ShibC, but also 60% of Scott, plus contracting with Unicon for Shib UI. They now need to come in w a plug-in architecture for local extensibility;  Need them on a call (iif not CompArch)

- ongoingsustainability of all components; but investment $$ will dropping
- BennO to discuss SCG client consulting rates; What share can I2 help defray; running behind on PHPCake (I2 indicated support: Ask How much and When)

- Grouper tean burn rate is fine as a sustainability budget, too.  Are there $$ new features needed? Bump for Vivek already discussed SZ and CHy and approved; BB-L also slow to bill.

- Tech Debt: Shib UI, COmanage;

- Check $ late October to bring in Consent; KevinM needs to clarify that I2 caretaking isn't adequate for ongoing development

- Evolveum: $50-75K set aside for partnership under review by Lucy Cobel (Atty); Co-develop of training; Packaging expected to take 1/3 to 1.0; Unicon MAY be a mP partnership; don't love how they organize themselves, record time; Misagh is expected to produce and not just participate; Need to know their intentions

COm <--> grouper

 - conclusion of the discussions about messaging (the last building block for the combined suite) led by Keith

----------
Do Component Architects agree to the following TIER assertion?

The core messaging protocol, the one used internally between different TIER components, is AMQP 0.9.1, with support for external endpoints of various types: AMQP 1.0, STOMP, MQTT, JMS (SDK) and others.

The reference messaging implementation for TIER is RabbitMQ. That is, when we demo or deliver running code for messaging, the support will be provided by RabbitMQ. From the interoperability perspective, the TIER standard is around the protocol and not the particular implementation.
----------

 - final pre-read documentation, TIER Accomplishments by Thematic Grouping, which will form the basis of the Face to Face meeting content.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HUzeLVm7aqYY7Up3U7s4kh_3qOa0MXE0c_-cUHSc3Jc/edit#
	The pre-read document will be turned into appropriate “slideware” for discussion at the F2F
	but the primary focus of the meeting will be on DISCUSSION with the assembly there.

Please start building the list of assertions/questions you wish to discuss / affirm / refute in the assigned time slots for the Face to Face.

Here are some suggested assumptions we may need to solicit conversation about:

 - The relevance/importance of Consent in the portfolio.
	My personal belief is that this is a crucial component for the future
	but our recommendations need to be asserted to/ratified by the PAG given the amount of work yet to be completed here.

 - The impacts of GDPR on the portfolio and those who consume it (all used globally).
	While I don’t want us to rat-hole on the meeting – this may have specific issues we may
	want to highlight and solicit feedback.

 - “How urgent is support for OIDC or other protocols in the offering?”
	(This would not only inform priorities for 2018 but for beyond as
	we re-integrate funding support with the whole of the Internet2 / Community Trust and Identity efforts.)

 - Given the direction of COmanage in research, we should also be prepared to talk about
	the direction that the BTAA may have on our future features and investment in its design.

Looking forward to seeing (most of) you there… AND then at Tech Ex next week!

Steve Zoppi
[10:46 AM]
You can send me the invitation - but I'll still try here as well ... The template from which you derive your inputs is "Assumptions Inputs - TIER Components (Template).xlsx" It's an excel document.  Some have converted it to a gsheet ... fine ... But I need it in XLSX form when we're done.


90% of our costs are in LABOR - so our focus is on LABOR in the first passes.

Pass 1 describes (loosely) how people and agencies are used


The Shibboleth workbooks are used as a finished example of where we will end up.


There are FOUR passes in all ... the first THREE passes are from the working groups / leaders with my "sanity checking" passes TWO and THREE (on the corresponding tabs.


Pass 2 - takes information provided in Pass 1 and further refines them into categories.  The Working Group / Lead (informed by the information in Pass 1) takes the "activities" and breaks them down, by category, into a corresponding Full Time Equivalent of labor ...


Column C "CUR FTE" shows about how much time is being spent TODAY on the named activity ...


Column E identifies the MINIMUM SUSTAINABLE amount of FTE required to maintain that activity.


Column G is the "Optimimum" FTE required, not only for sustainability, but for also having discretionary time to invent and sustain NEW invention or functionality.


We then "reality check" those numbers together and come up with a mutually agreed-upon "sane" version of those numbers and assign them as hard values in columns "D" "F" and "H"....


Key deliverables of the activity are identified in this pass so we can communicate this information adequately in the next pass (and also remember how we got to these numbers in the first place when other work gets in the way).


Notes ..... are Notes.


Pass 3 takes Pass 2 inputs and "pivots" them into an external discussion document which summarizes, by activity and category, the "Current", "Min Sustainable", and "Optimal" scenarios.


MY job (after that) is to do ONE more pass and consolidate ALL of these into a master labor plan which we will all review and validate.


Pass 4 will be broadly used for labor planning and presentation to the Trust and Identity PAG / TCIC for discussion about what our next steps should be as we plan through the end of 2018,


If this all makes sense ... I will re-post it into the meeting minutes so everyone else can have a hack at it - .... OR we can just re-post it into the broader slack channel.

----------
Warren Curry [11:05 AM]
@wkaufman this better?


Bill Kaufman
[11:12 AM]
@sjzoppi Thanks Steve, we will review at 1 EST.  I copied you on the invite in case you can make it.

Steve Zoppi
[11:13 AM]
Okay - thanks ... and I want to make sure that BennO is also clear about this (as should everyone who needs to contribute) so if this explanation is helpful (which we will determine in about 45-ish minutes) then I will re-post it into the running notes.


Keith Hazelton [11:33 AM]
What about Round 1 and Round 2 columns? what are the calendar dates?

Bill Kaufman
[11:35 AM]
Sheet 2

Steve Zoppi
[11:37 AM]
I need Pass 1 (first sheet) by monday so I have time to pull information together for the wednesday meeting.

[11:38]
IF you are able to input your "Current / Min / Optimal" information on Pass 2 by then ... All the better for me.

Keith Hazelton [11:38 AM]
Copy that

Steve Zoppi
[11:39 AM]
But that will need to be done between the 17th and 21st.

Keith Hazelton [11:39 AM]
So….round 1 is rough estimates, and round 2 is final values?

Steve Zoppi
[11:40 AM]
At the completion of round two (in which you propose the "optimal" numbers and I work with you to make sure I understand them and that we haven't missed anything) ... then we will use those estimates as "final"

Keith Hazelton [11:40 AM]
As bill says, these round1.,2 headers are found on Pass 2, columns D,E,F,G,H,I

Steve Zoppi
[11:41 AM]
Terminology: PASS "N" are the Tabs...

Keith Hazelton [11:42 AM]
I see now.

Steve Zoppi
[11:42 AM]
ROUND "N" is on PASS 2

Keith Hazelton [11:42 AM]
gotcha

Steve Zoppi
[11:42 AM]
where N = 1..2...?   I'm only leaving room for two rounds because it's not rocket-science.

Keith Hazelton [11:42 AM]
:smiley:

Steve Zoppi
[11:42 AM]
:slightly_smiling_face:

Keith Hazelton [11:44 AM]
OK, Warren and  I will do PASS 1 by Monday for APIs, Messaging, midPoint-based Registry, and share with BennO so he can fill in the numbers re COmanage.

Steve Zoppi
[11:46 AM]
I'll make an attempt to do the COmanage stuff with you so BennO can enjoy his vacation and just redline whatever he sees to be out of whack.

[11:46]

h6. 2016-01-01 14:36  timeline for TIER R1

The "TIER related objective" is to deliver
  - a fully integrated suite of components
  - with documented / supported set of APIs
  - in a container that can be deployed easily by the TIER campuses.

I would like to construct a timeline that contains:

·**   Features which are directly related to those TIER objectives and their
			anticipated timeline with a confidence level of April Delivery indicated as (High, Medium, Low)

			o   Features related to TIER which require resourcing to be delivered by April –
				Need either time or cost estimate so I can plan an execution budget that I can get in motion
				to underwrite whatever’s necessary at the top of January.

			o   MOST important are Packaging and API related tasks. (Documented APIs, Container and deployment specifications, etc.)

·**   Features which are NOT directly related to those TIER objectives but
			have a high or Medium probability of being included in your respective “ready to deliver” code bases by April.
			This is important because it shows the community that much work has already been in progress
			and will be incorporated in releases as time progresses as well.

So to build the timeline and deliverable list –
	I’m looking for very high level understanding of those
	features / tasks / milestones
	with any known or anticipated predecessors
	as well as their associated levels of effort.

For planning purposes and unless you state otherwise:
ALL labor calculations that I do are based on YOUR labor estimates of “continuous applied effort”
to deliver a given feature.
I translate that into “burdened cost” … an example is that if I think it would take me
10 hours of continuous applied effort to develop a feature, I translate that into 14 hours of actual labor cost
(my planning assumption is that * actual productivity*  is only 60% due to
other interruptions, restarts, meetings, etc.).

Please let me know if you need any other information but this is a starting point for high-level costing and timing that will ultimately get turned into a committed schedule.

F-ticks:

Hi all,

As part of my work with the Canadian Access Federation that CANARIE operates, I have implemented native support for F-TICKS[1] logging for Shibboleth V3 and have opened a feature enhancement ticket to suggest it be part of the Shibboleth distribution so others may be able to benefit from it's inclusion in the distro:

https://issues.shibboleth.net/jira/browse/IDP-840

One aspect that is hard to describe for the ticket (beyond my observations) is interest in such a feature being in the core.

As it is not a code update, but a configuration, it's not a big change, but is a change nonetheless.  I have already described a few aspects of the use of F-TICKS in the ticket but if I have missed your federation or site use of the extra logging format, please voice your support either in the ticket or on the users list.  By doing so I hope the request will have more information than just my observations on what it would mean to include it in the Shibboleth distro in a useful and sustainable fashion that would benefit the most users of the IdP software.

Many thanks to those who helped out on this and for the Shibboleth team to have a framework in v3 that made this much easier  to accomplish all without coding.

For those who need a bit more background on F-TICKS keep scrolling to see more detail..

Thanks!

Chris

What is F-TICKS?
F-TICKS[1] is a log format that masks user identifying sign in information to allow for statistical collection of access logs while protecting personally identifiable information.  While F-TICKS is used widely in eduroam[2], other higher education federations also use it in the SAML space.

Having F-TICKS support in Shibboleth v2.x was slightly tedious and had more dependancies than desired but is a key operational aspect to assist with logging and deriving access metrics in the federated sign on space.  The difficulty to implement on v2 prevented more widespread adoption  of the technique.

In Shibboleth v3 it was much easier to refactor it into the logging infrastructure and leverage the bean support to accomplish the same thing with no external dependancies. (hurray!)  Having this available to any Idp operator I think would be very beneficial and allow tools like the UK's Raptor[3], SWAMID's FLOG tools[4] to work more seamlessly than before and potentially simplify deployments.

to Chris, Hans, grouper-users
Hi Hans, Hi Chris,
The VOOT connector existed before last implementation but it did not provide a full implementation of the protocol (that since first definition has evolved many times).

The current implementation of the VOOT connector has been developed by myself within the JRA3T1 task of GN3+.
I've developed the plugin on version 2.1.5 but the adapted it to version 2.2. The code on github, in agreement with Chris, has been merged into Internet2 repository at branch_2_2.

However I think you should be able to compile and have it working even on 2.1.5.
To be sure everything is working correctly you can execute the test suite on your code base in a development environment.
The tests should be good enough to give you good confidence everything is working properly on your code base.

Cheers, Andrea

  - config reloads, too
  - COmanage is a different beast that Shib/Grouper
  - Loong time before OIDC/OAuth actually take over from SAML in our world; OIDC spoiled by Google, OAuth spoiled by M$

TIER R1:
- stable APIs, and (possibly)

- "Deployer-focused" User Interface.

So we will need

- Updated (current) prioritized roadmap documents from each of you
  in whatever form that you can provide them. We don't want to have to go to three JIRA locations to have that working document,
  so for discussion purposes we will work off of whatever you can provide.

----------
*  :: In scope for DSAWG

- COmanage has done some work w Grouper APIs and can look at CIFER APIs
- COmanage deploys attribute authorities, perhaps work with Shib could help on that
- SZ - we hope to leverage the CIFER API work, want to match API's
[ Emily]  get  coherent CIFER API work from Keith
- Chris - need a link to the CIFER wiki
- https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/CIFER/API
*  need an index of the various APIs
  [ BO] to pull list together
*  [ KeithH] will further enrich the APIs and define the versioning mechanism We want to bookmark the ones we want to focus on

[ SZ]: trying to establish a 1/3 floor agreement with Sp.Cow and Unicon
*  is there a plan on how the API's will be managed? and versioned?
*  we all need to be in sync, managed APIs from Shibb being included
*  CIFER APIs have focused on functional areas
*  Management APIs are needed (in the Shib context, for reloading, etc)
*  Keith should be aware that we need to normalize A set of management APIs for all the products
*  Chris: APIs for Grouper are confusing because there are web services and
  there is also a hooks interface to interact w Grouper.
  There are also Java libraries that enable you to tie into the Grouper API and you can call functions directly.
  CIFER tries to standardize how systems talk to other systems.
  But Grouper might also have its own APIs

*  SteveZ: the dev teams can decide what they want to expose and what they don't want to expose
*  managed API's for all products
*  Groups- how many, what size, who,
*  Benn: need guidance on the primary objectives when looking at what APIs are needed
*  Challenge:  how will we maintain documentation ?  and have one reference base to work from.
*  For TIER 1st Release: need a package that includes APIs

- obligation to get Shibb 3 into everyones hands asap
- latest release of Grouper and want to make sure people can install properly
- Need to inventory what we have: Suggestions welcome
