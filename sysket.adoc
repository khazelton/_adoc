Rebekah Ahrens
Hi Keith, I’m thinking about our action items due to Method Engine, as well as thinking ahead to our team meeting next week. I’d like you and I to do some pre-work to set the stage to get some of these action items done soon.

I’ve drafted a document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bYnRWddhRch_nBE_JvWdmxRtmNXmNY-W8gHzTxrdwgk/edit#heading=h.nbnyniijjgfv[]
to itemize the list of content items per category. I tried to think back to my own experience to stick some items in already. 

]√ Can you add a few items to each category before next Tuesday (August 20)? 

During the mtg with the full team next week I’d like to assign them to add anything additional.

]√ Reach out to Grady to ask him to provide an example before August 23?

] Let’s wrap up 

-√ items in each category
- examples (Friday)

before we go too far on the last 2 deliverables. I will still mention them during our mtg next week though to make sure everyone knows we still need to finish those.

Does that work for you?  

Keith
Yes. When you mention the last 2 deliverables you mean "missing functionality” and “overlapping functionality"?

Rebekah Ahrens

Meeting Notes

Thank you for your time today. Below is a summary of our call.

Rebekah, I will follow up with you with our questions and next steps!

===== IAM "Sketch" Diagram Tool Meeting Summary

*- Existing Diagram Formats and Expectations -*
The group discussed the existing formats and structures of IAM diagrams, including the common 4-quadrant layout with green and blue boxes. They explored how this format could be used to represent different IAM components and their relationships, and the need to balance providing guidance while also allowing flexibility for users to customize the diagrams.

*- Representing IAM Components and Functions -*
The team delved into how specific IAM components like Grouper, midPoint, and CoManage could be represented in the diagram, including their core competencies and areas of overlap. They discussed the importance of providing clear labeling and descriptions to help users understand the capabilities of each component.

*- Addressing Diverse IAM Environments -*
The group acknowledged the need to accommodate a wide range of IAM environments, from those using Internet2's TAP components to those relying on more homegrown or Microsoft-based solutions. They explored ways to make the diagram tool flexible enough to represent these diverse setups, potentially through customizable icons and the ability to add user-defined components.

*- Engaging the Community for Feedback and Adoption -*
The team discussed the value of involving the broader IAM community, particularly the Catalyst members, as early adopters and contributors to the diagram tool development. This would help ensure the tool meets the needs of a diverse set of institutions and capture a range of IAM architectures and use cases.

*- Next Steps and Action Items -*
The group identified next steps, including collecting additional questions, providing example end-user diagrams, and wireframing potential features and functionality of the diagram tool. They agreed to follow up offline to continue refining the tool's design and development plan.

Hi Keith,

I know we are meeting next Tuesday to discuss the Blueprint assets, but I went ahead and put together a chart of the assets provided so far (attached).

I have added columns for items we would like to cover, and I realized we may want to add more fields. Can you take a look at this and let me know if this makes sense to you? I am also happy to jump on a call if you would like to discuss prior to our meeting next week.

Fields:
Asset Name
Asset Links (these links go to the assets you provided that I moved to our Method Engine Google folder)
Asset Description
Category (I would like to assign each asset to a category - or multiple - that it could be found under)
Re-created (does asset need to be re-created)
Current Application (that was created in)
Modifiable (should this be static or can it be modified)


My goal is to get enough information that we will be able to proceed with the project quote and some general recommendations regarding the platform, style, functionality. I believe we will need to answer these items as well as the above:
How R&E facilities are currently using/building blueprints
Estimated total number of Assets
Asset File Types
Asset Categories

Thank you,
Billie

We're entering Phase I: Milestone: Identify artifacts to preserve and refresh (June 2024)

SZ: The only purpose for this scope is to "face lift and codify" what we have already

SZ: I think that the "overlay" concept is applicable with regard to +
iconographic / scenario projection and other types of artifacts like that

SZ: the gist of it is what we've discussed already and the "vision" is to:

* Select from the myriad existing sources, those visual/narrative artifacts which merit conservation / repurposing.
* Update and Make the assets derived from those sources +
** Canonical / consistent +
** across all of our Visualizations/representations +
** re-useable / consumable by/for others.

_2024-05-17 17:08 basic structure of the arch refresh discussion_

*- categories of existing materials -*

- classic ref arch & variations (note subject and style between different annotations)
- check iam 101+ and prov 101+ presentations
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/12CL4iGxU3k9NDxdoqJHGK_2yHlnA89z0zfJXBj1ZK0s/edit#heading=h.foyea42voc7t[] <- Cirrus Identity draft _IAM Reference Architecture_

- Large collection of plantuml diagrams in system-arch repo

- Lists of capabilities and functions (incl.Gartner), in product documentation


*- potential work areas -*

* Matrix: Rows are IAM capabilities and functions, columns are TAP components, a check in a cell means that function is provided by that TAP component, with annotations on the cell as needed
** Illustrative example: Rows: Access management functionality; Columns: Grouper and midPoint

*- challenging product marketing material and RFP response assertions that their product meets the listed requirements -*

* "Access to services and resources is allowed or denied according to established policy"

** This assertion is subject to a set of qualifications and conditions:
*** "Access to services and resource"
**** Access by whom?  What kinds of access? Which services and resources?

*** "Allowed or denied"
**** How is the allow/deny decision enforced?

*** "According to established policy"
**** How do policies map from natural language to computable syntax and semantics across disparate systems? 
**** What is your core policy language?
**** Is it possible to verify that defined policies have been followed in any and all cases?
**** Are there services and resources that cannot be managed with these IAM services? 

- - -


* Observation: Campus order of deployment shapes function-to-component mapping decisions
** one pattern we see a lot is 1) Shib, 2) Grouper, 3) midPoint and/or COmanage

* Working assumption: Any statement on The capabilities of an ideal IAM environment is subject to a set of necessary and sufficient conditions
