The meeting today is to help me understand what we are contributing to TIER and what benefits UW is getting from our contribution.  I also want to be sure we are coordinating our efforts between architects and middleware.
 
If I missed anyone, please forward the meeting invite to them.
 
Thanks,  Chris
